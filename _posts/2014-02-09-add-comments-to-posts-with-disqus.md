Most blogs have a section where viewers can add comments. 

Given that jekyll produces a static site I find it's better to off-load this to a **comment service** like ***Disqus***.

These services are always improving so rather than explain it here I'll link out to their always up-to-date documantation: [Disqus Help](http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472138-jekyll-installation-instructions)
