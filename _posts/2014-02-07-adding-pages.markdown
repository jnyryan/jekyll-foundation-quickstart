Adding pages is easy. If you want to add a page called ***about*** just add about.html or about.markdown to the root folder

To keep URLs simple e.g. **mysite.com/about** instead of **mysite.com/about.html**, simply create a folder called about and put your markup in a file called index.html or index.markdown

In this project, I put them under a folder **p** (it stands for pages...) to group them all together.
